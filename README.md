## Accomplishment Checklist
### Backend Server Framework of Choice
Node.js
* Why?
  * 
### Database with Source Text and Translation Attempts
Mongo Database
* Why?
  * With the short time limit that I had to build the application, I chose to use Mongo because of its simple Collection
  and Document Database design. I was able to design the schemas for both the User and Source Collections in under an hour.
  * The ability to work with the Mongoose API greatly enhanced the speed and efficiency of work
